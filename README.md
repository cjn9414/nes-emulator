# nes-emulator
My attempt at making an emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

## Status
Development is currently in progress! Feel free to check the recent commits to see what I have been working on.

## Motives
I really want to learn much more about low-level programming, specifically programming in C. Upon searching for project ideas, I came across a [gameboy emulator](https://cturt.github.io/cinoop.html) that really caught my eye. As a huge fan of the Nintendo Entertainment System, I thought I would try my hand at making an emulator for it.

## Legal
I am in no way advocating the use of illegally obtained software with this emulator. I will not and cannot supply any software to use with this emulator. Any use of this emulator is under the assumption that the owner of the software that is being used has given permission to use it freely. All the information used in the development of this emulator was legally obtained and is credited in this file. **It is illegal to run any software on this emulator for which you do not have permission to use.**
